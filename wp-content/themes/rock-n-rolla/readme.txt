===========
ABOUT THEME

Rock N Rolla is a theme designed specifically with bands in mind. It functions as a great looking blog theme,
but also has some excellent (and optional) home page features to help promote your latest material,
tours or any other content you want to. Display a Soundcloud, ReverbNation, Mixcloud or Spotify track or playlist.
Display a large format image slider which also supports YouTube video. Or add a post carousel to promote tour dates
or other content you want to highlight. Of course you can also upload your own logo and control the theme colors as well.

===========
HOW TO USE THE THEME

Using the Rock N Rolla theme is very easy. Make sure your home page is set to display your latest posts.
Then in the Customizer check the Home Page Features to control if the slider appears, and whether you want
to display the optional pages below the slider (as in the theme demo at http://rocknrolla.band/).
Lastly, be sure to set a beautiful featured image for all your posts so that they look great.
